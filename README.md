# Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict housing prices in King County, a county in Washington state. I used multiple linear regression modeling to perform analysis on the provided dataset, kc_house_data.csv. I specifically wanted to explore X, Y, and Z.


# Data Description

Data Set Used:

* kc_house_data.csv
* list any procsessed datasets...
* would probably be a good idea to do so...

# Results
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Results are in [Question 1](./notebooks/) [Question 2](./notebooks/) and [Question 3](./notebooks/) Jupyter Notebooks.


# Conclusions/Recommendations
The analysis leads to the following conclusions/recommendations around the home prices in King County.

* __Item1__  Blah blah blah

* __Item2__  Blah blah blah


# Next Steps/Future Work

Futher analysis into the following areas could yield additional insights.

* __Validate Waterfront NAN values__  I did a quick search for free APIs that would allow me to check the distance from lat/long coordinates to the nearest coastline. I did find a for-fee API [KB Geo's Distance to Coast Web Service](https://www.kbgeo.com/). It might be interesting to check the waterfront UNKNOWNS/NANS.

* __Future2__  Blah blah blah
